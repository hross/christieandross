It was a random Thursday in August (the 25th to be exact), almost exactly a week before their two year anniversiary, when Ross suggested they go see a movie down the street from their apartment. It seemed a bit odd to Christie that Ross really wanted to go see [Midnight in Paris](http://www.sonyclassics.com/midnightinparis/), a movie he knew was a Woody Allen movie, but not much else about.

As it turned out, Ross had something special planned for that night. He had secretly rented out one of the theaters at the Bethesda Row Cinema and coordinated with the employees to pretend like they were going to see a 7 pm show. In fact, Ross had an engagement ring in his pocket as he tried to stroll casually next to Christie on the way to the theater.

Unfortunately, he couldn't remember which side of Christie he would probably be on and it turned out he picked the wrong pocket for the ring box! Christie thought it was wierd that he insisted on walking on her left side.

After making it to the theater without further incident, they "bought" their tickets and headed into the theater. Christie was excited to get popcorn, worrying that they wouldn't have dinner until late that night (little did she know they weren't going to see a 2 hour movie). Finally, they headed inside and sat in the center section. Christie thought it was odd that there were no other patrons in the theater that night (must have been a slow night).

After a couple of nervous minutes of anticipation (for Ross, anyway), the lights went down and the "show" started. At first Christie thought they were previews and diverted her attention to the popcorn, but then she recognized the photo montage on screen as being pictures of her and Ross.

At the end of the movie, Ross got down on one knee, took out the engagement ring and proposed. Afteward they headed to one of their favorite local restaurants for a romantic dinner.

The picture background for this page is the movie theater and the other picture of Ross and Christie toasting with roses is from the dinner.
