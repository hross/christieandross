## Flight Information

The Washington, D.C. metro area is served by three major airports. 

[Reagan National Airport in Arlington, VA](http://www.metwashairports.com/reagan/reagan.htm)

[Dulles International Airport in Dulles, VA](http://www.mwaa.com/dulles/dulles.htm)

[Baltimore/Washington Airport in Baltimore, MD](http://www.bwiairport.com/en)

While BWI is farther away, it is the best place to fly in if you are taking a Southwest flight. Reagan National and BWI are accessible via rail and metro, while Dulles has a shuttle service.

June is a popular tourist month in D.C., so we recommend booking flights early!
