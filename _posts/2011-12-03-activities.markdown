Here are a few ways to spend your time in D.C.!

* *Explore classic Washington, D.C. landmarks and museums*... by visiting the famous Smithsonian museums and zoo, visiting George Washington�s historic home at Mount Vernon, or strolling on the National Mall.
* *Trek up 365 steps*... into the US Capitol dome with your favorite member of Congress as trailblazer. Guided tours of the Capitol, which include the iconic rotunda, can be reserved through a congressional office or via the Capitol Visitor Center�s online reservation system. But the dome can be ascended only with a member of Congress as escort.
* *Relive the news from the past and even make some of your own*... by visiting our favorite museum, the Newseum. The 250,000-square-foot museum of news offers visitors an experience that blends five centuries of news history with up-to-the-second technology and hands-on exhibits.
* *Go monument-hopping at night*... stopping first at the Korean War Veterans Memorial, where 19 stainless-steel soldiers appear to come to life with white spotlights capturing their expressions. Next, see the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, where the statues, walls, and waterfall are especially evocative in the moonlight.
* *Slip behind closed doors*... on a tour of the Pentagon. Led by personnel on active duty, the 1�-mile tour of the labyrinthine building includes the Hall of Heroes and the 9/11 Memorial Chapel. Tours can be arranged through the Pentagon Tour Web page, House and Senate offices, and foreign embassies.
* *Take refuge on a secluded island*... as you stroll the 2� miles of woodsy trails that loop around tranquil Theodore Roosevelt Island. Native Americans used the 89-acre island in the Potomac River as a makeshift fishing camp, but today the only full-time residents in the national park are deer, turkeys, foxes, eagles, and a statue of our 26th President. 
* *Marvel at the beauty*...of the Washington National Cathedral. This historic cathedral took 83 years to build and even includes a lunar rock and a sculpture of Darth Vader on top of its West tower. It was damaged by the East Coast Earthquake in 2011, but is now open to visitors during repairs.
