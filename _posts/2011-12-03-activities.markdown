Here are a few ways to spend your time in D.C.!

* *Explore classic Washington, D.C. landmarks and museums*... by visiting the famous [Smithsonian](http://www.si.edu/) museums and zoo, visiting George Washington's historic home at [Mount Vernon](http://www.mountvernon.org/), or strolling on the [National Mall](http://www.nps.gov/nacc/index.htm).
* *Trek up 365 steps*... into the [US Capitol](http://visitthecapitol.gov/) dome with your favorite member of Congress as trailblazer. Guided tours of the Capitol, which include the iconic rotunda, can be reserved through a congressional office or via the Capitol Visitor Centerï¿½s online reservation system. But the dome can be ascended only with a member of Congress as escort.
* *Relive the news from the past and even make some of your own*... by visiting our favorite museum, the [Newseum](http://www.newseum.org). The 250,000-square-foot museum of news offers visitors an experience that blends five centuries of news history with up-to-the-second technology and hands-on exhibits.
* *Go monument-hopping at night*... stopping first at the [Korean War Veterans Memorial](http://www.nps.gov/kowa/index.htm), where 19 stainless-steel soldiers appear to come to life with white spotlights capturing their expressions. Next, see the [Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial](http://www.nps.gov/kowa/index.htm), where the statues, walls, and waterfall are especially evocative in the moonlight.
* *Slip behind closed doors*... on a tour of the [Pentagon](http://pentagon.afis.osd.mil/). Led by personnel on active duty, the 1.5 mile tour of the labyrinthine building includes the Hall of Heroes and the 9/11 Memorial Chapel. Tours can be arranged through the [Pentagon Tour Web page](http://pentagon.afis.osd.mil/), House and Senate offices, and foreign embassies.
* *Take refuge on a secluded island*... as you stroll the 2+ miles of woodsy trails that loop around tranquil [Theodore Roosevelt Island](http://www.nps.gov/this/index.htm). Native Americans used the 89-acre island in the Potomac River as a makeshift fishing camp, but today the only full-time residents in the national park are deer, turkeys, foxes, eagles, and a statue of our 26th President. 
* *Marvel at the beauty*...of the [Washington National Cathedral](http://www.nationalcathedral.org). This historic cathedral took 83 years to build and even includes a lunar rock and a sculpture of Darth Vader on top of its West tower. It was damaged by the East Coast Earthquake in 2011, but is now open to visitors during repairs.
