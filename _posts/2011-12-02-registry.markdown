We've decided to bring a charitable focus to our wedding registry. While we love the potential possiblities for gifts on a traditional registry, we also feel fortunate to have more than we need. We've decided to donate a portion of our registry proceeds to the Red Cross and UNICEF. Please use the link below to donate via our registry:

Direct donations are great, but if you feel you would like to give a gift, you can also use purchase items at these registries, which will donate portions of the cost to charity:
