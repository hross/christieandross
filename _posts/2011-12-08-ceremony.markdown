The ceremony will take place at 4:30 p.m. on June 9, 2012 at Tudor Place in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Construction began on the home in 1789 and was later bought in 1805 by Martha Washington’s granddaughter, Martha Custis Peter, and her husband, Thomas Peter, who expanded the home. The ceremony will be held in the Bowling Green garden of the home. 

## Parking

Parking will be limited to the streets around Tudor Place, so it is recommended you arrive early and carpool if possible. While we do not anticipate trouble finding parking, parking will be limited and you may need to park a few blocks from the ceremony location.

It is also recommended you arrive early in order to allow time to enjoy the many gardens before the ceremony. 

In the case of inclement weather, the ceremony will be moved next door to the administrative building.
